On the day of her death, Sarah had spent the afternoon with a close friend, Emma, who had brought her a homemade herbal tea. Unbeknownst to Sarah, Emma had recently discovered that her husband was having an affair with Sarah and decided to take revenge. Emma had laced the tea with a slow-acting poison, knowing it would take hours to affect Sarah. Later that evening, Sarah locked herself in her room to work on a project, unaware of the poison coursing through her veins. As the poison took effect, Sarah succumbed to its lethal dose, collapsing onto the floor without any struggle. The locked room mystery puzzled investigators, but the lack of struggle and forced entry, combined with the autopsy revealing the presence of poison, eventually led them to Emma. Sarah's death, initially a baffling mystery, was solved by piecing together her last interactions and the hidden motives of someone she once trusted.",

She pushes against the lid, and to her astonishment, it gives way. Crawling out of her grave in the dead of night, Emily finds herself alone and disoriented. With no immediate way to contact her family, she takes refuge in an abandoned cabin nearby.

These letters are part of a grand psychological experiment orchestrated by her future self to observe how perceived threats influence her decision-making and behavior. The purpose of this experiment is twofold: to study the impact of constant, yet false, warnings on her ability to make confident decisions and to train her younger self to trust her instincts despite the false alarms. Over time, Sarah's younger self becomes overly cautious and hesitant, struggling to make confident decisions. However, the ultimate goal is for her to learn to differentiate between real and false threats, thereby strengthening her intuition and decision-making skills. This controlled environment prepares Sarah to handle real-life situations with confidence and improves her ability to make quick, effective decisions under pressure. The letters, though initially a source of anxiety, ultimately serve to make her a stronger and more resilient individual.",
