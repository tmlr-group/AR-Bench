## Now create testimony of each suspect in following outline:
"""

create_timeline_prompt = """Your task is to generate the timeline of each suspect in a murder mystery, as shown in the example. In this story, the timeline should match the case scenario and the information of the suspect.

Type of story:
Given an outline of a murder mystery, we aim to create the timeline of action of a suspect in the story
Instruction:
give a comprehensive timeline of the day the crime happened to reach this goal, The timeline should begin when the suspect wake up and end when the victim's body is found..

## Important rules:

1. the timeline must match the existing information of the outline I give you, including suspect's reason_at_scene, suspicion, motive, opportunity, access_to_weapon, testimony
2. the timeline must be comprehensive that include the all time of the day, if given outline does not provide enough information to create the timeline, try to fullfill some irrelevant information.
3. Your timeline should not conflict with previous generated timeline of other suspects
4. If the suspect is the murderer (i.e. the key is_murderer is Yes), the timeline should involve the action about the murder (e.g. sneak to victim's room and strike him with a knife)
5. the timeline should match the general information, such as the time, the location, the cause_of_death, the weapon and the initial_information
6. You should check the validation of the timeline that does not conflict with existing knowledge if given.
7. Your output should be a form of expansion of given outline, do not modify the original information about the outline
8. your output should be also a json form.
