Feedback: I was indeed at Riverside Park earlier that evening, but I left around 5:30 PM after my meeting with Dr. Harper, and then I headed to a local caf√© for another meeting, which lasted until 6:00 PM, providing me with a solid alibi for the time of the murder.

Question to Dr. Samuel Reed: Did you have any disagreements with Dr. Amelia Harper recently? Feedback: While there was some underlying tension between us regarding the credit for our research, our discussion at Riverside Park was intense but professional, and we didn't have any overt disagreements that would suggest a motive for such a heinous act.

Feedback: I've met Dr. Harper a few times at social events, but I didn't have any plans to meet her that evening, although I am curious, what makes you think she was at Riverside Park that night?

Question to Ethan Turner: Did you notice anyone else near the scene of the murder at Riverside Park? Feedback: Yes, I saw Professor Henry Collins and Dr. Laura Bennett arguing earlier, and then Dr. Bennett walked away looking upset, and later I saw Dr. Samuel Reed arriving, looking flustered, but, uh, have you ever noticed how the sunlight filters through the trees in Riverside Park, it's really quite beautiful, and I've been meaning to bring my camera to capture it.
Question to Dr. Samuel Reed: Did you see anyone else at Riverside Park when you arrived for your meeting with Dr. Harper? Feedback: Yes, I did notice Ethan Turner nervously pacing nearby when I arrived at the park around 4:30 PM, but I didn't think much of it at the time as I was focused on preparing for my meeting with Dr. Harper.
Question to Alice Parker: Did you have any knowledge of Dr. Harper's plans or meetings scheduled for that evening?

Question to Professor Henry Collins: Did you notice anything unusual about Ethan Turner's behavior at the park? Feedback: He seemed nervous and agitated, but I was too preoccupied with my own thoughts after the argument with Amelia to pay much attention to him at the time.
Question to Dr. Laura Bennett: Did you see anyone else at the park after your meeting with Dr. Harper? Feedback: I noticed Ethan Turner near the crime scene, nervously pacing, at around 3:15 PM, but I was too absorbed in my own turmoil to give it much thought at the time.
Question to Ethan Turner: Did you have any disagreements with Dr. Harper during your meeting that day?

Question to Dr. Samuel Reed: Did you see Dr. Laura Bennett at Riverside Park during your visit? Feedback: I don't recall seeing Dr. Laura Bennett at Riverside Park during my visit, but my attention was primarily focused on my meeting with Dr. Harper, and I may not have noticed everyone who was present in the area.
Question to Alice Parker: Did you have any professional conflicts or disagreements with Dr. Harper in the past? Feedback: Dr. Harper and I did have a rather heated debate at a conference a few months ago regarding a research paper, but I wouldn't call it a conflict, although I did notice she seemed a bit... uneasy after our discussion, which now that I think about it, is quite interesting given the circumstances.
Question to Professor Henry Collins: Did you have any professional disagreements with Dr. Harper recently? Feedback: We had a long-standing rivalry, and our meeting at the park was actually about a recent discovery I had made, which she unfortunately dismissed as inconsequential compared to her own work.
Question to Dr. Laura Bennett: Did you see Professor Henry Collins at Riverside Park during your visit? Feedback: I didn't notice Professor Henry Collins at Riverside Park during my visit, but I was quite preoccupied with my own thoughts and the tension from the meeting with Dr. Harper.
Question to Ethan Turner: Did you handle any ancient artifacts during your meeting with Dr. Harper that day? Feedback: Yes, I handed over the restored artifact to Dr. Harper, it was a, uh, a delicate process, and I was careful to handle it with gloves, but, uh, did you know that I've been having trouble with my workshop's heating system, and I'm worried it might damage some of my other projects?
Question to Dr. Samuel Reed: Did you notice any artifacts missing or out of place during your meeting with Dr. Harper?

Question to Alice Parker: Did you hear any rumors about tensions between Dr. Harper and her colleagues? Feedback: There were whispers about Dr. Harper being at odds with her research partner, Dr. Lee, over some discrepancies in their findings, and I've heard their working relationship had become quite strained, but I'm sure that's just gossip, or is it something more relevant to your investigation?
Question to Professor Henry Collins: Did you see or handle any artifacts during your time at Riverside Park? Feedback: I brought an ancient artifact to show Dr. Harper during our meeting, but I left it with her when I stormed off after our argument.
Question to Ethan Turner: Did you see Professor Henry Collins leave an artifact with Dr. Harper during your time at the park? Feedback: I don't think so, but I did see Professor Collins and Dr. Bennett arguing, and then Dr. Bennett walked away, and, uh, I noticed a bird building a nest in a nearby tree, it was fascinating to watch, and, oh, I just remembered that I need to return a book to the library, it's overdue.

Reason: 
1. Dr. Amelia Harper was killed with a heavy, ancient artifact, which suggests someone who had access to or handled such artifacts.
2. Professor Henry Collins admitted to bringing an ancient artifact to his meeting with Dr. Harper and leaving it with her after their argument.
3. Both Dr. Laura Bennett and Professor Henry Collins had heated discussions with Dr. Harper on the day of the murder, indicating possible motives related to professional disagreements.
4. Ethan Turner and Dr. Samuel Reed did not report any significant disagreements with Dr. Harper, nor did they admit to handling artifacts at the park.
5. Alice Parker was not present at the park, and her interactions with Dr. Harper were not of a nature that would suggest a motive for murder.
6. Professor Henry Collins had a rivalry with Dr. Harper and was at the park during the time of the murder, making him the most likely suspect with both motive and opportunity.

General Instruction for Solving a Murder Case:
1. Review the Case Details: Gather all known information about the victim, location, time, and any evidence collected.
2. Identify Key Suspects: List individuals with potential motives, access to the crime scene, or connections to the victim.
3. Analyze Evidence: Examine physical evidence, forensic reports, and witness statements for inconsistencies or connections.
4. Establish Timelines: Map out a detailed timeline of events for the victim and each suspect around the time of the murder.
5. Identify Motives: Investigate personal, financial, or emotional factors that may drive each suspect to commit the crime.
6. Determine Means and Opportunity: Evaluate each suspect's ability to commit the crime and whether they had access to the murder weapon or crime scene.
7. Plan Interrogations: Develop targeted questions to probe suspects' alibis, relationships with the victim, and knowledge of the crime.
8. Detect Lies and Gaps: Pay close attention to inconsistencies, evasive answers, or emotional responses during interrogations.
9. Correlate Evidence with Testimonies: Cross-check suspects' statements against physical evidence and other witnesses' accounts.
10. Eliminate Suspects: Rule out individuals who have solid alibis, lack motives, or are otherwise proven innocent.
11. Formulate a Theory: Synthesize all findings to build a logical narrative of how the murder occurred and who is most likely responsible.
12. Present the Case: Ensure the conclusion is supported by clear evidence, consistent reasoning, and a definitive connection to the suspect.
13. Validate the Outcome: Reassess the reasoning and evidence to confirm the solution is accurate and free from bias or oversight.

As he prepared, I slipped away to a secluded spot. Timing was crucial. I waited until he was alone, then struck swiftly with the nunchaku. The blow was precise, a result of years of martial arts training. He crumpled, and I quickly concealed the weapon. 
No one saw the act itself, but witnesses later confirmed I was at the site. I admitted being there, knowing it was unavoidable. The nunchaku were later found at my house. My jealousy had driven me to this point, and now, there was no turning back.
